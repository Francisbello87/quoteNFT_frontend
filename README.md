> Frontend application for the **QuoteNFT** system â€” built with **Next.js / React (TypeScript)**, connecting to your smart contract interface.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

**QuoteNFT Frontend** serves as the user interface for the QuoteNFT ecosystem â€” a fully on-chain NFT platform for minting, viewing, and managing quote-based NFTs.  
It interacts seamlessly with the deployed **QuoteNFT Smart Contract**, providing a smooth, responsive, and wallet-integrated Web3 experience.  

This app allows users to:  
- Connect their wallet (e.g. MetaMask)  
- Mint NFTs representing quotes or text content  
- View their minted NFTs  
- Interact directly with the blockchain through an intuitive UI  

---
## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)  
- npm, yarn or pnpm  
- The `quoteNFT_contract` deployed address & ABI  
- A wallet / provider (e.g. MetaMask) for interacting with the contract  

---

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Francisbello87/quoteNFT_frontend.git
cd quoteNFT_frontend
npm install
```
--- 

### Configuration

Create a `.env.local` (or `.env`) file in the root and add:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<your_deployed_contract_address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=<your_rpc_provider_url>
```

You may also need to configure network, keys, etc. depending on your frontend integration.

---

### Development

Start the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.  
Modify `app/page.tsx` or other components â€” changes hot-reload automatically.

---

### Testing (if applicable)

If you add frontend tests (Jest, React Testing Library), include:
```bash
npm test
```

And configure a GitHub workflow `test.yml` so your Tests badge works properly.

---

### Build & Deployment

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

You can deploy to platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or your preferred hosting.  
Example (Vercel):

- Connect your GitHub repo  
- Set environment variables  
- Deploy directly
